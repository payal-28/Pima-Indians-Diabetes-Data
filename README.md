# Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Data

This dataset is taken from Kaggle.
In this notebook i have done some EDA on the data like scaling of the data, outlier removal, missing values imputation etc.
Used Support Vector Classifier, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boost, K Nearest Neighbors to predict diabetes.
Used GridSearchCV to improve the results.

Finally compared the models to get the best model.
